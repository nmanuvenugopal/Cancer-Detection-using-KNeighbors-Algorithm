# Cancer-Detection-using-KNeighbors-Algorithm

* Cancer detection when the k = 1

* Cancer detection when k > 1 is done using two method. One is elbow method where we will be recording the error associated with each k values and later these error values are plotted to find the optimum values of k. This process is much more manual kind of stuff

* Second way of finding the optimum value of the K is cross validation using GridSearchCV. Here we have implemented a pipline to reduce the effort.

* we have evaluated the performance in both the cases and we could conclude that perfomace of the model is great when the k value is greater in this case k = 16.
